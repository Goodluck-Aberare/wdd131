      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <div class="about-content">
        <p>My name is Goodluck Aberare. I was born in Nigeria and currently live with my family in Lagos State. 
        I work as an Administrative Assistant in a logistics company, where I’ve gained valuable experience 
        in organization, communication, and teamwork. My family means the world to me, and I truly enjoy spending 
        quality time with them. I’m passionate about learning new things, improving my skills, and exploring 
        creative ideas that help me grow personally and professionally. I believe in hard work, positivity, 
        and making a meaningful impact wherever I go.</p>

        <p>Nigeria is located in West Africa and is often called the "Giant of Africa" for its large population, 
        cultural diversity, and growing influence on the continent. It is a nation blessed with rich natural resources, 
        vibrant traditions, and hardworking, creative people. Nigeria is made up of 36 states and the Federal Capital 
        Territory, Abuja, and is home to over 250 ethnic groups, including Yoruba, Igbo, and Hausa. Despite our 
        differences, Nigerians are united by a strong spirit of resilience, hospitality, and hope. From our colorful 
        festivals, delicious foods like jollof rice and pounded yams, to our world-famous music and entertainment 
        industry, Nigeria is a place full of life and inspiration.</p>
